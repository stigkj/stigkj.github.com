So, almost 7 months later I've finally managed to drag myself into a blog posting "position".
Hopefully this wont be the pattern for how long it will be between posts. It's not that I don't
have anything to say, it's more that I have too much to say and can never bear the thought of
writing _all_ of it down. Note to self: just write some of it down, then!

And now taking up the thread from the first post: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) was the blogging
engine I found which made me want to write a blog again. Then I was derailed, got mixed up with
bad boys like [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org) and [nesta](http://nestacms.org) and ended up
just being confused. What should I choose?

[Octopress](http://octopress.org) came to my rescue! I had looked at it before, but that was pre-2.0
days. Now it just shines with great design and a lot of great features. One of the greatest are the
very nice options for sharing code snippets...my code has never looked better! And it is still
Jekyll-based.

Now it is just finding out the theme for the next post. What about saying something about how to
get Chef to work properly under Windows, with package management and all?
