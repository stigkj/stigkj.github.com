Have you ever wanted to create a chat-with-me widget on your blog or
just on a regular web page, look no further! Here are the 3 easy steps
for creating a GTalk widget that can easily be included on any web
page.

First, a pre-requisite: you must have a Google account. I guess most
of us already have one...

Then, the steps:

1. Go to the [Google Talk chatback badge page](http://www.google.com/talk/service/badge/New)
2. Copy the generated HTML code into your blog/web site 
3. ...

Actually, that was just 2 steps, not 3. My bad.

There is one interesting thing about this chat widget: your visitor
does not need a Google account to use it, but will just appear as a
guest in the chat. Nice and easy for the visitor, but for you it 
might be problematic not knowing the visitor's identity.
